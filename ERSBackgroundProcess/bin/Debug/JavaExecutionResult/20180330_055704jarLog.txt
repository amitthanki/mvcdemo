AMQ9204: Connection to host 'quesvc8e5(2246)' rejected.

EXPLANATION:
Connection to host 'quesvc8e5(2246)' over '?' was rejected.
ACTION:
The remote system may not be configured to allow connections from this host.
Check the '?' listener program has been started on host 'quesvc8e5(2246)'. 
If the conversation uses LU 6.2, it is possible that either the User ID or
Password supplied to the remote host is incorrect. 
If the conversation uses TCP/IP, it is possible that the remote host does not
recognize the local host as a valid host. 
The return code from the '?''RemoteTCPConnection.protocolConnect' call was
'com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException[CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9771: SSL handshake failed.
[1=javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException[No appropriate protocol (protocol is
disabled or cipher suites are inappropriate)],3=quesvc8e5/10.174.11.44:2246
(quesvc8e5),4=SSLSocket.startHandshake,5=default]]' X('?'). 
Record the error values and tell the systems administrator.

AMQ9771: SSL handshake failed.

EXPLANATION:
The SSL handshake with host 'quesvc8e5/10.174.11.44:2246 (quesvc8e5)' failed.
The SSL handshake was performed using the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE).
ACTION:
The SSLSocketFactory used was 'default', where 'default' indicates that the
JVM's default SSLSocketFactory was used. 
The exception thrown by the 'SSLSocket.startHandshake' call was
'javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException[No appropriate protocol (protocol is
disabled or cipher suites are inappropriate)]'. Review the exception message
for a description of the failure. 
Also examine the error logs at the remote end of the channel. These may contain
additional information on why the SSL handshake failed.
